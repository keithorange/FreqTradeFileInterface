# FreqTradeFileInterface
_Enabling External Control and Data Exchange through File-Based Communication. Expand your FreqTrade bot's capabilities with seamless integration to external data sources, algorithms, and control mechanisms. Ideal for traders and developers seeking a flexible, file-driven approach to automate and extend their crypto trading strategies._


The code you have shared appears to be part of a custom implementation that extends FreqTrade, a popular open-source cryptocurrency trading bot, using file-based communication. This extension allows for external control and data exchange through file-based interaction. Let's delve into the key components of your code and explain their functionalities and interactions:

### CustomFreqtradeStrategy (FreqtradeStrategy.py)
- **Overview**: This class combines FreqTrade's trading strategy interface (`IStrategy`) with a custom `FileCommunicator`. It serves two primary functions:
  - **Writing Price Data**: For selected cryptocurrencies, it writes the price data to a file.
  - **Order Execution**: It executes buy and sell orders based on instructions specified in a file.

- **Key Functions**:
  - **populate_indicators()**: This method reads user-specified cryptocurrency symbols from a file and stores them. For each symbol, it calculates the growth from its starting price to the current price and saves this data back to a file.
  - **populate_buy_trend() & populate_sell_trend()**: These methods set buy or sell signals for the trading bot based on orders read from a file.

### FileCommunicator (file_communicator.py)
- **Purpose**: Manages file-based interactions, which include reading from and writing to files. It is used by the strategy for reading cryptocurrency symbols, price data, and order instructions.
- **Key Features**:
  - Methods like `_write_to_file()` and `_read_from_file()` facilitate the interaction with the filesystem, ensuring data persistence and retrieval for the trading strategy.

### FreqtradeHandler (freqtrade_handler.py)
- **Functionality**: This class seems to be an extension of the `FileCommunicator`, tailored specifically for handling FreqTrade's operational needs.
- **Operations**:
  - It manages file states, writes data requests (presumably to signal the strategy to perform certain actions), and reads data or orders from the files.

### CryptoHandler (crypto_handler.py)
- **Role**: Manages the overall cryptocurrency trading process.
- **Capabilities**:
  - Initializes and manages trading sessions with specified cryptocurrency pairs.
  - Fetches latest data and identifies top-performing cryptocurrencies.
  - Executes buy and sell orders through the `FreqtradeHandler`.

### Start-up Script (start_app_and_freqtrade.sh)
- **Purpose**: A bash script to set up and start the trading environment.
- **Actions**:
  - Activates the FreqTrade virtual environment.
  - Launches the main application (which presumably integrates the above components).

### Overall Workflow:
1. **Initialization**: Using `CryptoHandler`, a trading session is started with specified cryptocurrency pairs.
2. **Data Management**: `CustomFreqtradeStrategy` writes and reads price data and orders to and from files, using methods provided by `FileCommunicator`.
3. **Trading Decisions**: The strategy determines buy/sell signals based on the file data.
4. **Order Execution**: `CryptoHandler` uses `FreqtradeHandler` to execute these trades.

### Potential Use Cases:
- Automated trading with dynamic control through external scripts or applications.
- Integrating custom data sources or trading algorithms with FreqTrade.
- Experimenting with advanced trading strategies that require external data inputs or multi-bot coordination.

### Limitations and Considerations:
- **Security**: File-based communication must be secured, especially if used in a live trading environment.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and validation are crucial, given the dependencies on external files.
- **Performance**: Depending on the implementation, file I/O could introduce latency in trading operations.

This architecture provides a flexible and extendable framework for integrating FreqTrade with external data sources and control mechanisms, potentially unlocking new strategies and methods in crypto trading.
